## About this project:

This website was a code refactoring project for a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp in order to master semantic HTML and CSS elements.

This website was built with HTML and CSS.

## Summary of what was done:

The original HTML and CSS was littered with redundant class div tags and classes that should have been labeled as just selector elements.

Some examples of this were:

div class="header" instead of simply < header >

div class="search-engine'optimization" and 2 other different named classes that all followed all the same css properties.
  
  These classes were all combined in to one semantic class such as "body" or "row" to create much cleaner html and css code.
  
  Combining these original html classes into one also made creating the css much cleaner and simpler, and instead of having around 15 css tags for some sections, I was able to make 3 or 4 selectors.
